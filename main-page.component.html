            <span class="bolded">Habitat:</span><br>Butterflies live worldwide except the arctic. Nearly anywhere with nectar-producing flowers 
              will host butterflies. Butterflies are often polymorphic, and many species make use of camouflage, mimicry, and aposematism

              <span class="bolded">Nutrition:</span><br>
              Caterpillars eat leaves and other plant parts. Most butterflies prefer flower nectar, but others may feed on the liquids found 
              in rotting fruit, in ooze from trees, and in animal dung.</p>

            <span class="bolded">Physical description:</span><br>Ponderosa pine is a large-crowned tree with a straight trunk. 
            It is the largest of the western pine species, and usually grows to a diameter of two metres and can live
